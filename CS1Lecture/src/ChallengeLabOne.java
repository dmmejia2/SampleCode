		 *  PART III
		 *  1.	Analyze the budget and ability to pay the credit:
		 *  For completing this task, program has to ask user for the monthly expenses and the
		 *  number of credit cards customer has and the total payment amount for all credits cards.
		 *  We are assuming for this assignment that the interest of rate is fixed.
		 *  
		 *  a.	If the total amount of monthly payment from monthly expenses and credit cards already 
		 *  required is less than or equal to 35% of customer monthly salary, the credit will be accepted 
		 *  with a maximum of 10 times of customer monthly's salary.  
		 *  
		 *  b.	If the total amount of payments (including expenses and credit cards) is more than 35% and less than 50%,
		 *  the maximum credit will be 5 times of the customer monthly's salary.
		 *  
		 *  c.	Otherwise, the credit is denied and the program ends displaying an apology message. For instance, assuming
		 *  the customer's name is John Doe: "Sorry, John doe, your budget and ability of monthly payment is not enough for
		 *  getting a banking credit."
